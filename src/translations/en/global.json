    "description": "I am a Front End developer, starting in February 2021 as a self-taught. Trying different courses, I discovered that this was what I liked. I loved web development so I decided to continue studying it. In this study time, I was able to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and tools like Git and GitHub for version control. Currently, I am looking for a job, I have a great interest in showing the abilities acquired in the different courses that I take, and in the various group works that I carry out."
